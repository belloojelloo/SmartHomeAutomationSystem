# üè† Home Automation System using Dual Microcontrollers

This project is a smart home automation system built using two ATmega32 microcontrollers.

- The first MCU (called HMI_ECU) handles user input using an LCD and keypad.
- The second MCU (called CONTROL_ECU) controls the door, motor, buzzer, and other hardware.

The two MCUs communicate with each other using UART.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

| Folder        | Description                                        |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| HMI_ECU/      | Code for the interface microcontroller (LCD, keypad) |
| CONTROL_ECU/  | Code for the control microcontroller (motor, EEPROM, PIR, buzzer) |

Each folder has its own main.c file because each runs on a separate microcontroller.

How to Run It

You‚Äôll need:

- Two ATmega32 microcontrollers
- External EEPROM
- LCD + Keypad
- Motor (via H-bridge)
- PIR sensor
- Buzzer

Use Atmel Studio or AVR-GCC to compile each folder‚Äôs main.c separately, then upload one to each microcontroller.

Make sure to wire the UART pins between the two MCUs correctly:
- HMI_ECU TX ‚Üí CONTROL_ECU RX
- HMI_ECU RX ‚Üê CONTROL_ECU TX

## ‚ùì FAQ

‚ùì Why are there two main.c files?

Because this project uses two separate microcontrollers. Each one has its own program and runs independently but they talk to each other using UART.

‚ùì Why are there two folders?

To keep the two systems organized. You compile and flash each folder‚Äôs main.c to a different chip.
